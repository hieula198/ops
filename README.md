# Project Purpose

This infrastructure management project is a personal endeavor created to document my experiences with deploying and managing multi-environment infrastructure. As the sole developer and maintainer, my goals are:

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document real-world experiences with ECS, EKS, and on-premise infrastructure deployment
- **Community Contribution**: Provide proven solutions and approaches for infrastructure management
- **Learning Resource**: Create reference materials for those new to modern infrastructure technologies
- **Reusable Tooling**: Develop Infrastructure as Code templates that can be adapted for different environments

This project represents my journey in DevOps and infrastructure automation, and I hope it serves as a valuable resource for others in the community.
