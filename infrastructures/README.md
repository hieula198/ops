## Directory Structure

- `ecs/` - ECS infrastructure configuration
- `eks/` - EKS infrastructure configuration
- `on-premise/` - On-premise infrastructure with Ansible

## Getting Started

Each infrastructure component has its own setup instructions:

```bash
# For ECS deployment
cd ecs && make deploy

# For EKS deployment
cd eks && make apply

# For on-premise deployment
cd on-premise && make all
```

## Prerequisites
